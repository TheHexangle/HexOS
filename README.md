# HexArc - Testing Branch

My Linux install that contains all costomised files on my Artix system allog with programs and commands needed to install/operate said system. This is more of a personal repository for me to look back on to remember the things I have changed and installed allong with helpfull commands I tend to forget.

This is not a distrobution! It's just a repository for the configs and changes I make to my system.
